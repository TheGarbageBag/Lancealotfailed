<p>One Piece has received praise for its storytelling, art, characterization, and humor. It has received many awards and is ranked by critics, reviewers, and readers as one of the best manga of all time. Several volumes of the manga have broken publishing records, including the highest initial print run of any book in Japan. In 2015, One Piece set the Guinness World Record for "the most copies published for the same comic book series by a single author". It was the best-selling manga for eleven consecutive years from 2008 to 2018, and is the only manga that had an initial print of volumes of above 3 million continuously for more than 10 years, as well as the only that had achieved more than 1 million copies sold in all of its 100 published tankōbon volumes.</p>

        <h4 id="One_Piece"> What is the One Piece </h4>
<p> Nobody knows yet, all that we know is that the One Piece is a legendary treasure that was owned by the former King of the Pirates "Gold Roger" and his final words on the execution platform when asked what about the One Piece was "you want my treasure, you can have it, I left everything I gathered together in one place. Now you'll just have to find it!." This one quote started the New Pirate generation with everyone scrambling to find the mythical treassure located on the final island in the grandline. </p>

        <h4 id="Crew"> The Crew </h4>
<p> Monkey D. Luffy's crew, He stated at the beginning of the series that he wanted to gather 10 people on his crew, as of yet he has only gathered 9. First was Zoro, then Usopp, Sanji, then Nami, after gathering these four he gathered 5 more after heading to the Grand Line.</p>
        <h4 id="Season"> Why I love One Piece </h4>
<p> The reason I love One Piece, this show made me so happy and filled with adventure, that was its main premise, Absolute freedom, there is no good guys no bad guys, everyone is there for their own purpose. Even where there is no essentially "villans" there is stll very evil people, in such a light hearted show there is still very many really dark subjects in it, slavery, racism, kidnapping, and drugs. Another thing that I love about One Piece is that Eiichiro Oda wrote the story to be where no one dies, instead their dream is broken which in Oda's words is a fate worse than death. This comes with a lot of very emotonal scenes so I picked a few that I absolutely loved and that made me cry.</p>
